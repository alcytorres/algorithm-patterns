# Majority Element
"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3]
Output: Invalid Input. There must be a majority for this algo to work even if running it outputs 2 or 3. 

# Why: Practices Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm for efficient majority element detection.

# Task: Find the majority element in an array, which appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
# Assumption: The majority element always exists in the array.
# Example: nums = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] → Output = 2 (2 appears 4 times, ⌊6/2⌋ = 3, 4 > 3)
