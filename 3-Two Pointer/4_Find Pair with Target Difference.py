# 4. Find Pair with Target Difference
"""
Task: Find two numbers in an array whose difference is a given target. The larger number minus the smaller should equal the target. 
    - Return None if no pair is found.
    - Assume target is non-negative

Example 1: [1, 4, 3, 7], target = 6 → [1, 7]
Example 2: [1, 3, 8],    target = 2 → [1, 3]

Why: Prepares for Two Sum by practicing pointer movement for a condition.

"""
Explanation if left == right: 
               right += 1  
This part of the find_pair_with_difference code prevents the left and right pointers from pointing to the same number after left moves forward.

How to know when to Use if left == right: right += 1
      - Two pointers (left, right) compare/process pairs in a loop.
      - Moving one pointer (left += 1) might make left == right.
      - You need different elements (e.g., for sum, difference).

   - Sign it’s needed: Overlapping pointers give wrong results (e.g., arr[right] - arr[left] = 0).

   - Examples: Pair-finding (difference = target), two-sum, sorted array problems where left catching right breaks logic.


   

Why different pointers for Two Pointer problem #4 and #7?
    Target Difference: Starts left=0, right=1 (close) to check if arr[right] - arr[left] = target.
    
    Target Sum: Starts left=0, right=end (far) to check if arr[left] + arr[right] = target.

Why loop differently?
    Target Difference: Loops until right reaches end, moves left or right to adjust difference, ensures left != right.
    
    Target Sum: Loops while left < right, moves left up or right down to adjust sum.

*** Easy Takeaway: 
    Difference uses nearby pointers to find a gap; 
    Sum uses far pointers to find a total. ***
