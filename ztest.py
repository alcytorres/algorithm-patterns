ALCY — LINKED LISTS STUDY GUIDE (Tight, interview-ready)

What I changed & why (high-impact only):
- Renamed overlapping function names (SLL vs DLL) to avoid collisions in one file.
- Added light safety checks to O(1) delete to prevent None errors.
- Removed duplicate prints / repeated demos that added noise.
- Kept DLL as “understand only,” minimal demo; trimmed commentary.
- Moved “optional utilities” to the end and commented out their demo calls to avoid state confusion.

Stick to this and your separate write-ups for the 8 problems you listed.
