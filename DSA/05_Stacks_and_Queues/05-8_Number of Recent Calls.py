# 933. Number of Recent Calls

"""
You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the RecentCounter class:
    # RecentCounter() Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
    # int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time t, where t represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range [t - 3000, t].

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

Example 1:
    # Input: ["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
    # [[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
    # Output: [null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

    # Explanation
    # RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
    # recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
    # recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
    # recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
    # recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3

Constraints:
    1 <= t <= 10⁹
    Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
    At most 10⁴ calls will be made to ping.


Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/description/





---
TLDR:
  • Every time you call ping(t), a new request happens at time t.
  • Your job: return how many requests happened in the last 3000 milliseconds.

How to do it:
    1) Remove timestamps older than t - 3000  
    2) Add t  
    3) The number of timestamps you have left is the answer

That's the whole problem.


---
TLDR YOU SHOULD MEMORIZE
  • The current time (like 3002) can be huge.
  • We only care about keeping timestamps within 3000 milliseconds of that time.

Meaning:
  • Keep timestamps ≥ t - 3000
  • Throw away timestamps < t - 3000


---  
SUPER SIMPLE VERSION OF THE QUESTION

You are building a counter that tracks how many “pings” (requests) happened recently.

Every time you call ping(t), it means:
    "A ping just happened at time t."

Your job:
    When ping(t) is called, return how many pings happened in the last 3000 milliseconds,
    INCLUDING the new ping at time t.

In other words:
    Count all pings where their time is between t - 3000 and t.

Important:
    • Times always increase (each t is bigger than the previous one).
    • Only pings inside the last 3000ms matter — older ones do NOT count.

Example:
    ping(1)     → only ping is at time 1                   → return 1
    ping(100)   → pings at times 1 and 100                 → return 2
    ping(3001)  → pings at 1, 100, 3001 → all in window   → return 3
    ping(3002)  → ping at 1 is now too old → remove it     → return 3

Goal:
    Build a class RecentCounter with a ping(t) function that does this.



---
Think of it like this
You have a timeline of pings.
When a new ping comes in:
    1. Remove all pings older than t - 3000.
    2. Add the new ping.
    3. Count what's left.

Time: O(1) amortized
  - Let N be the total number of pings made so far.
  - Each ping(t):
      • Removes outdated timestamps from the front of the deque.
      • Each timestamp is added once and removed once over the whole program.
      • So all pops across all calls sum to O(N), giving O(1) amortized per call.
  - Appending t and returning queue length are O(1).
  - Overall per operation: O(1) amortized.

Space: O(N)
  - The deque stores only timestamps within the past 3000 ms.
  - In the worst case (dense pings), up to all recent pings may remain in the deque.
  - Overall: O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(1) amortized
  - Add new ping and drop old ones; each timestamp is pushed and popped once.

Space: O(N)
  - Queue holds recent timestamps within the 3000-ms window.




---
Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • Every ping(t) wants the number of requests in the last 3000 ms → the window [t-3000, t].

    • Old timestamps outside this window must be removed.

    • A queue works perfectly because timestamps arrive in increasing order — the oldest is always at the front.

---
Why this code Works:
    • Queue stores all recent timestamps.

    • For each ping(t):
        - Remove timestamps < t - 3000 (they're too old).
        - Append the new time t.
        - The queue now contains ONLY valid times → its length is the answer.

    • Efficiency:
        - Each timestamp is added once and removed once → O(1) amortized.
        - No scanning through the whole history each time.

    • Intuition: Think of a sliding 3000-ms window that moves forward with each ping — the queue holds exactly what's inside that window.

---
TLDR:
    • Maintain a queue of timestamps and drop anything older than 3000 ms — the queue size is the answer.

    Queue before: [1]
    Remove: none (1 ≥ -2900)
    Add 100 → [1, 100]
    Return: 2

    3) ping(3001)
    Window = [3001-3000, 3001] = [1, 3001]
    Queue before: [1, 100]
    Remove: none (1 ≥ 1)
    Add 3001 → [1, 100, 3001]
    Return: 3

    4) ping(3002)
    Window = [3002-3000, 3002] = [2, 3002]
    Queue before: [1, 100, 3001]
    Remove: 1 (because 1 < 2 → outside window)
    Add 3002 → [100, 3001, 3002]
    Return: 3

    Final outputs: [1, 2, 3, 3]

Q: What is the best way to build a queue in python?

    • from collections import deque

    • deque = the fast, correct way to do a queue.
    • Always use it when you need FIFO (First In, First Out).

    

---
Q: IMPORTANT: Do pings carry over between print statements?
  • YES — and this is the entire point of the problem.

  • Each call to ping(t) updates the same queue inside the same RecentCounter object.

That's why:
  • ping(1) → queue is [1]
  • ping(100) → queue is [1, 100]
  • ping(3001) → queue is [1, 100, 3001]
  • ping(3002) → queue becomes [100, 3001, 3002]

  

---
Q: Why a QUEUE, not a STACK?

Key behavior:
    • Oldest pings should be removed first (those that fall out of the left side of the window).
    • Newest pings should stay as long as they are inside the window.

That is:
    • First In → First Out  (FIFO)  → a QUEUE

A stack is:
    • Last In → First Out   (LIFO)  → would remove the newest ping first (wrong).

So we use:
    from collections import deque
    and call:
        append(t)   → enqueue (add to back)
        popleft()   → dequeue (remove from front)


        


Q; Why does it not fail with print(obj.ping(3001))?  3001 is more than 3000?

ASCII Timeline + Animation for 933. Number of Recent Calls

Goal:
    VISUALLY understand what RecentCounter is doing
    and why we use a QUEUE with a 3000ms time window.

We'll walk through this example:

    obj = RecentCounter()
    print(obj.ping(1))     # 1
    print(obj.ping(100))   # 2
    print(obj.ping(3001))  # 3
    print(obj.ping(3002))  # 3

Each call:
    • ping(t) means: "a request happened at time t"
    • We keep only pings in [t - 3000, t]
    • We remove old pings, add t, then return how many are left


===========================================================
PART 1: Concept – The 3000 ms Sliding Window
===========================================================

Think of pings as dots on a timeline.

For each ping(t):
    1. Move current time to t
    2. Valid time range is [t - 3000, t]
    3. Remove any pings < t - 3000 (too old)
    4. Add the new ping t
    5. Count the pings that remain


===========================================================
PART 2: Step-by-Step "Animation" with Queue Contents
===========================================================

We maintain:
    queue = a FIFO list of ping times (oldest at front)


1) ping(1)
-----------

t = 1
Window = [1 - 3000, 1] = [-2999, 1]

Before:
    queue = []

No pings to remove (queue empty)

Add t = 1:
    queue = [1]

Count:
    len(queue) = 1

Printed output:
    1


2) ping(100)
-------------

t = 100
Window = [100 - 3000, 100] = [-2900, 100]

Before:
    queue = [1]

Check oldest ping: 1
    Is 1 < -2900?  → No, so we keep it

Add t = 100:
    queue = [1, 100]

Count:
    len(queue) = 2

Printed output:
    2


3) ping(3001)
--------------

t = 3001
Window = [3001 - 3000, 3001] = [1, 3001]

Before:
    queue = [1, 100]

Check oldest ping: 1
    Is 1 < 1?  → No, equal to 1, so keep

Check next: 100
    Is 100 < 1? → No, keep

Add t = 3001:
    queue = [1, 100, 3001]

Count:
    len(queue) = 3

Printed output:
    3


4) ping(3002)
--------------

t = 3002
Window = [3002 - 3000, 3002] = [2, 3002]

Before:
    queue = [1, 100, 3001]

Check oldest ping: 1
    Is 1 < 2? → Yes → too old → REMOVE it

Now:
    queue = [100, 3001]

Check new oldest: 100
    Is 100 < 2? → No → keep it

3001 is also ≥ 2 → keep it

Add t = 3002:
    queue = [100, 3001, 3002]

Count:
    len(queue) = 3

Printed output:
    3

Now pings:
    ●100, ●3001

Both 100 and 3001 are inside [2, 3002].

        # popleft() → queue = [100, 3001]
        # 100 >= 2 → keep
        # while condition: False → exit

        # --- Step 2: Add the current ping ---
        # Why? This is a new request at time t
        self.queue.append(t)  # Add t to the end of the queue

        # --- Example: ping(1) ---
        # queue.append(1) → queue = [1]

        # --- Example: ping(100) ---
        # queue.append(100) → queue = [1, 100]

        # --- Example: ping(3001) ---
        # queue.append(3001) → queue = [1, 100, 3001]

        # --- Example: ping(3002) ---
        # queue.append(3002) → queue = [100, 3001, 3002]

        # --- Step 3: Return the count of recent pings ---
        # Why? len(queue) = number of pings in [t-3000, t]
        return len(self.queue)

        # --- Example Outputs ---
        # ping(1):     len([1]) = 1
        # ping(100):   len([1, 100]) = 2
        # ping(3001):  len([1, 100, 3001]) = 3
        # ping(3002):  len([100, 3001, 3002]) = 3


# Test the class
obj = RecentCounter()
print(obj.ping(1))     # 1 → [1]
print(obj.ping(100))   # 2 → [1, 100]
print(obj.ping(3001))  # 3 → [1, 100, 3001]
print(obj.ping(3002))  # 3 → [100, 3001, 3002]
