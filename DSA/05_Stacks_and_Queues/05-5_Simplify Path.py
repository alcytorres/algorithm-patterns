# 71. Simplify Path

# You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

# The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:
    # A single period '.' represents the current directory.
    # A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
    # Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
    # Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.

# The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:
    # The path must start with a single slash '/'.
    # Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
    # The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
    # The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
    # Return the simplified canonical path.

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/

# Example 1:
    # Input: path = "/a/b///c/.././d/../f/"
    # Output: "/a/b/f"
    # Explanation:
    # Extra slashes are treated as one.
    # "." means current directory (ignored).
    # ".." moves up one level.
    # Simplified path: "/a/b/f"

# Example 2:
    # Input: path = "/home/"
    # Output: "/home"
    # Explanation:
    # The trailing slash should be removed.

# Example 2:
    # Input: path = "/home//foo/"
    # Output: "/home/foo"
    # Explanation:
    # Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

# Example 3:
    # Input: path = "/../"
    # Output: "/"
    # Explanation:
    # Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

# Example 4:
    # Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
    # Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
    # Explanation:
    # A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

# TLDR:
# Given a Unix-style file path string
# Simplify it to its canonical form by:
#   • Removing redundant slashes (`// → /`)
#   • Ignoring current directory markers (`.`)
#   • Going up one directory for (`..`)
#   • Keeping valid folder names (like `...`)
# Return the final simplified absolute path starting with `/`

"""
Time: O(N)
  - Let N = length of the path string.
  - Splitting the path by '/' takes O(N).
  - Iterating through all parts:
      • Each part is processed once.
      • Stack operations (append, pop) are O(1).
  - Joining stack elements into the final string takes O(N).
  - Overall: O(N).

Space: O(N)
  - Stack stores valid directory names (worst case: every segment is valid).
  - The final string also takes O(N) space when joined.
  - A few loop variables (part, path components) use O(1).
  - Overall: O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(N)
  - Each directory name is processed once.

Space: O(N)
  - Stack holds directory names to form the simplified path.

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • The path must be simplified by resolving ".", "..", and redundant slashes.

    • A stack is used to keep track of valid directories — like walking through folders step-by-step.

    • Each ".." means “go up one folder,” so we pop from the stack if possible.

---
Why this code Works:
    • Data structure: stack stores the directory path being built.

    • Technique:
        - Split the path by '/' into parts.
        - Skip "" (extra slashes) and "." (current directory).
        - On "..", pop the last valid directory if it exists.
        - Otherwise, push the directory name onto the stack.

    • Efficiency: O(N) time and O(N) space — each path segment is processed once.

    • Intuition: Imagine navigating a file explorer — when you go into a folder, add it to the path; when you click “up one level,” remove the last folder.

---
TLDR:
    • Split the path and use a stack to simulate moving through directories — push folders, pop for "..", skip "." and empty parts.

Quick Example Walkthroughs:

Example 1: path = "/a/b///c/.././d/../f/"
----------------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'a', 'b', '', '', 'c', '..', '.', 'd', '..', 'f', '']

    Stack = []

    ''   → skip
    'a'  → push → ['a']
    'b'  → push → ['a','b']
    ''   → skip
    ''   → skip
    'c'  → push → ['a','b','c']
    '..' → pop  → ['a','b']
    '.'  → skip
    'd'  → push → ['a','b','d']
    '..' → pop  → ['a','b']
    'f'  → push → ['a','b','f']
    ''   → skip

    Final: "/" + "a/b/f" → "/a/b/f"
    Output: "/a/b/f" ✅


Example 2: path = "/home//docs/"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'home', '', 'docs', '']
    Stack = []

    'home' → push ['home']
    '' → skip
    'docs' → push ['home', 'docs']

    Final: "/" + "home/docs" → "/home/docs"
    Output: "/home/docs" ✅


Example 3: path = "/../"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', '..', '']
    Stack = []

    '..' → try to go up, but stack empty → skip

    Final: "/" + "" → "/"
    Output: "/" ✅


Example 4: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'home', 'user', 'Documents', '..', 'Pictures']
    Stack = []

    'home' → ['home']
    'user' → ['home','user']
    'Documents' → ['home','user','Documents']
    '..' → pop → ['home','user']
    'Pictures' → ['home','user','Pictures']

    Final: "/" + "home/user/Pictures"
    Output: "/home/user/Pictures" ✅

Q: What does `continue` do in this solution?

  • `continue` tells Python to SKIP the rest of the current loop
  and move on to the next iteration.

  • In this code, it's used when `part` is either:
    - an empty string '' (from multiple slashes like "//"), or
    - a single dot '.' (which means "current directory" in Unix paths)

- When either of those appears, we don't need to do anything — 
  we simply skip and go to the next `part`.

Example:
---------
    path = "/home//./foo/"
    split → ['','home','','.','foo','']
    → parts '' and '.' trigger `continue` → skipped
    → stack ends up as ['home','foo']

✅ Prevents adding useless or invalid entries to the path.

Q: How do extra slashes (// or ///) get removed?

A: Two steps:

1. path.split('/') → automatically turns multiple slashes into EMPTY strings ('')
   Example:
   "/a/b///c/" → split gives: ['', 'a', 'b', '', '', 'c', '']

   → All those '' come from extra slashes!

2. This line IGNORES the empty strings:
   if part == '' or part == '.':
       continue    → skips them completely!

So yes:
   • split('/') creates '' for extra slashes
   • continue skips every '' → they disappear!

Result: "/a/b///c/.././" → becomes clean "/a/b"

# STRING METHOD: 
.split()
# What it does: Splits string into list based on delimiter.
# Why use it: Parses strings into tokens efficiently.
# How it works: Default delimiter is whitespace; optional maxsplit.
# When to use: Tokenizing inputs in word or array problems.
# Time/Space: O(n) time (n = string length), O(n) space for list.

# Syntax:
string.split(separator)  # Returns list; 'separator' optional (defaults to whitespace)

# Basic Example 1 (Default Whitespace):
s = "a b  c"
print(s.split())  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c']

# Basic Example 2 (Custom Delimiter):
s = "1,2,3"
print(s.split(','))  # Output: ['1', '2', '3']

# Basic Example 3: Splitting a path (LeetCode-relevant)
path = "/a//b/c/"
print(path.split('/'))
# ['', 'a', '', 'b', 'c', '']  ← empty strings come from extra slashes

# Basic Example 4 (No Delimiter):
s = "abc"
print(s.split())  # Output: ['abc']

# DSA Example (Word Parsing):
text = "hello world"
print(text.split())  # Output: ['hello', 'world']

📘 split() Mini Cheat Sheet

split()                → smart whitespace split
   • collapses spaces
   • trims ends
   • no empty strings

split(delimiter)       → literal split
   • every delimiter counts
   • keeps empty strings
   • no trimming/collapsing

Examples:
" a  b ".split()       → ['a','b']
"/a//b/".split('/')    → ['','a','','b','']
