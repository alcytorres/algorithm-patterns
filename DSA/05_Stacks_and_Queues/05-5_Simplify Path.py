# 71. Simplify Path

# You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

# The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

# A single period '.' represents the current directory.
# A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
# Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
# Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.
# The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

# The path must start with a single slash '/'.
# Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
# The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
# The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.
# Return the simplified canonical path.

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/description/

# Example 1:
    # Input: path = "/home/"
    # Output: "/home"
    # Explanation:
    # The trailing slash should be removed.

# Example 2:
    # Input: path = "/home//foo/"
    # Output: "/home/foo"
    # Explanation:
    # Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

# Example 3:
    # Input: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
    # Output: "/home/user/Pictures"
    # Explanation:
    # A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

# Example 4:
    # Input: path = "/../"
    # Output: "/"
    # Explanation:
    # Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

# Example 5:
    # Input: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
    # Output: "/.../b/d"
    # Explanation:
    # "..." is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

"""
Time: O(N)
  - Let N = length of the path string.
  - Splitting the path by '/' takes O(N).
  - Iterating through all parts:
      • Each part is processed once.
      • Stack operations (append, pop) are O(1).
  - Joining stack elements into the final string takes O(N).
  - Overall: O(N).

Space: O(N)
  - Stack stores valid directory names (worst case: every segment is valid).
  - The final string also takes O(N) space when joined.
  - A few loop variables (part, path components) use O(1).
  - Overall: O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(N)
  - Each directory name is processed once.

Space: O(N)
  - Stack holds directory names to form the simplified path.

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • The path must be simplified by resolving ".", "..", and redundant slashes.

    • A stack is used to keep track of valid directories — like walking through folders step-by-step.

    • Each ".." means “go up one folder,” so we pop from the stack if possible.

---
Why this code Works:
    • Data structure: stack stores the directory path being built.

    • Technique:
        - Split the path by '/' into parts.
        - Skip "" (extra slashes) and "." (current directory).
        - On "..", pop the last valid directory if it exists.
        - Otherwise, push the directory name onto the stack.

    • Efficiency: O(N) time and O(N) space — each path segment is processed once.

    • Intuition: Imagine navigating a file explorer — when you go into a folder, add it to the path; when you click “up one level,” remove the last folder.

---
TLDR (one sentence):
    • Split the path and use a stack to simulate moving through directories — push folders, pop for "..", skip "." and empty parts.

Quick Example Walkthroughs:

Example 1: path = "/home/"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'home', '']
    Stack = []
    'home' → push ['home']
    Final: "/" + "home" → "/home"
    Output: "/home" ✅


Example 2: path = "/home//foo/"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'home', '', 'foo', '']
    Stack = []
    'home' → push ['home']
    '' → skip
    'foo' → push ['home', 'foo']
    Final: "/" + "home/foo" → "/home/foo"
    Output: "/home/foo" ✅


Example 3: path = "/../"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', '..', '']
    Stack = []
    '..' → try to go up, but stack empty → skip
    Final: "/" + "" → "/"
    Output: "/" ✅


Example 4: path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', 'home', 'user', 'Documents', '..', 'Pictures']
    Stack = []
    'home' → ['home']
    'user' → ['home','user']
    'Documents' → ['home','user','Documents']
    '..' → pop → ['home','user']
    'Pictures' → ['home','user','Pictures']
    Final: "/" + "home/user/Pictures"
    Output: "/home/user/Pictures" ✅


Example 5: path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
--------------------------------
    Split → ['', '...', 'a', '..', 'b', 'c', '..', 'd', '.', '']
    Stack = []
    '...' → ['...']
    'a' → ['...', 'a']
    '..' → pop 'a' → ['...']
    'b' → ['...', 'b']
    'c' → ['...', 'b', 'c']
    '..' → pop 'c' → ['...', 'b']
    'd' → ['...', 'b', 'd']
    '.' → skip
    Final: "/" + ".../b/d" → "/.../b/d"
    Output: "/.../b/d" ✅

    




    


Q: What does `continue` do in this solution?
--------------------------------------------

- ✅ `continue` tells Python to **skip the rest of the current loop** 
  and move on to the next iteration.

- In this code, it’s used when `part` is either:
    - an empty string '' (from multiple slashes like "//"), or
    - a single dot '.' (which means "current directory" in Unix paths)

- When either of those appears, we don’t need to do anything — 
  we simply skip and go to the next `part`.

Example:
---------
    path = "/home//./foo/"
    split → ['','home','','.','foo','']
    → parts '' and '.' trigger `continue` → skipped
    → stack ends up as ['home','foo']

✅ Prevents adding useless or invalid entries to the path.
