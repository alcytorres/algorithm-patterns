# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
 
# Example 1:
    # Input: head = [1, 1, 2]
    # Output: [1, 2]

# Example 2:
    # Input: head = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
    # Output: [1, 2, 3]

"""
Time: O(N)
  - Let N = number of nodes in the linked list.
  - The algorithm traverses the list once using a single pointer (curr).
  - For each node, at most one comparison and possibly one link adjustment are made → O(1) per step.
  - Overall: O(N).

Space: O(1)
  - Only one pointer variable (curr) is used to traverse the list.
  - No additional data structures are created.
  - Overall: O(1).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(N)
  - Single pass removes duplicates in one traversal.

Space: O(1)
  - Constant space — only one pointer used.

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • The list is already sorted — so duplicates are always next to each other.

    • We only need to remove consecutive nodes with the same value.

    • We do this in-place by skipping over duplicates instead of creating a new list.

---
Why this code Works:
    • Data structure: Linked list with nodes connected by `.next` pointers.

    • Technique: Iterate through the list with a pointer `curr`.
        • If curr.val == curr.next.val → duplicate → skip it using `curr.next = curr.next.next`.
        • Else → move forward to next node.

    • Efficiency: O(N) time since we scan the list once, and O(1) space since we modify in place.

    • Intuition: Like cleaning up consecutive repeats — if you see the same number twice in a row, erase the extra one.

---
TLDR:
    • Walk through the list once and skip nodes that have the same value as the current node.

---
Quick Example Walkthrough:

Example: head = [1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 3]

    Step 1: curr = 1 → next = 1 → duplicate → skip → list becomes [1 → 2 → 3 → 3]  
    Step 2: curr = 1 → next = 2 → move to 2  
    Step 3: curr = 2 → next = 3 → move to 3  
    Step 4: curr = 3 → next = 3 → duplicate → skip → list becomes [1 → 2 → 3]  

Final Answer: [1, 2, 3]

Q: Where do we set `head` to point to the first node?

- When we call the function like this:
    result = deleteDuplicates(a)

- The variable `a` represents the first node in the linked list (value = 1).

- Inside the function definition:
    def deleteDuplicates(head):

  the parameter `head` now points to whatever we passed in — in this case, node `a`.

- So, `head` automatically becomes a reference to the first node
  at the moment the function is called.

✅ In short:
  • We don't manually write `head = a` in our code,
  • because it happens implicitly when we call `deleteDuplicates(a)`.



---
Q: Why do we return `head` at the end of the solution?

- `head` points to the start of the linked list.
    • Even though we move `curr` through the list during the loop,
    • `head` always stays fixed at the first node.

- After we finish removing duplicates,
    • the modified list still begins at the same starting node.

- By returning `head`, we give back the entire updated linked list
    • starting from its first node — so the caller can access and print it.

✅ In short:
  • We return `head` because it represents the entry point
  • to the new, duplicate-free linked list.
