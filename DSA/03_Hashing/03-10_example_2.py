# 2248. Intersection of Multiple Arrays

# Example 2: Given a 2D array nums that contains n arrays of distinct integers, return a sorted array containing all the numbers that appear in all n arrays.

# For example, given nums = [[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]], return [3, 4]. 3 and 4 are the only numbers that are in all arrays.

# Example:
    # Input: nums = [[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]]
    # Output: [3, 4]
    # Explanation: The only integers present in each of:
        # nums[0] = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5], 
        # nums[1] = [1, 2, 3, 4], and 
        # nums[2] = [3, 4, 5, 6] 
        # are 3 and 4, so we return [3, 4].

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-multiple-arrays/solutions/


# Import defaultdict for counting element occurrences
from collections import defaultdict

def intersection(nums):
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Count occurrences of each element in all arrays
    for arr in nums:
        for x in arr:
            counts[x] += 1

    # Get number of arrays
    n = len(nums)
    # Initialize result list for common elements
    ans = []
    
    # Collect elements appearing in all arrays (count equals number of arrays)
    for key in counts:
        if counts[key] == n:
            ans.append(key)
    
    # Return sorted list of common elements
    return sorted(ans)

nums = [[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]]

"""
Time: O(N + k log k)
  - Counting all elements across arrays into a hash map: O(N), where N is the total number of elements.
  - Scanning the map to filter elements with frequency equal to number of arrays: O(U), where U is number of distinct elements (≤ N).
  - Sorting the intersection result: O(k log k), where k is the size of the intersection.
  - Overall: O(N + k log k) (upper bound O(N + U log U) if k ≈ U).

Space: O(U) ≈ O(N)
  - Hash map stores counts for up to U distinct elements.
  - Result list takes O(k), but that's usually not counted as extra.
  - Overall: O(U) auxiliary space, which in the worst case is O(N).

Final: sorted([3, 4]) = [3, 4]



Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • We're counting how many arrays each number appears in.

    • A number belongs in the answer only if it shows up in all arrays.

    • We use a hash map (counts[x]) to track the appearance count for each number across arrays.


Why this code Works:
    • Hash map role: counts[x] accumulates how many arrays contained x.

    • Condition: after counting, any x with counts[x] == n (n = number of arrays) must be present in every array → include it.

    • Efficiency: one pass over all elements to count, one pass over keys to filter, then sort the result — no need to compare arrays over and over.  


TLDR:
    • Count appearances of each number across arrays and return the numbers whose count equals the number of arrays.


Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [[3, 1, 2, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]]

    Step 1 (count):
        • After all arrays → counts = {3:3, 1:2, 2:2, 4:3, 5:2, 6:1}

    Step 2 (filter + sort):
        • Keep keys with count == 3 → [3, 4]
        • Sorted result → [3, 4]

    Final Answer: [3, 4]

Time: O(N)
  - Count occurrences: O(N), where N is the total number of elements across all arrays.
  - Loop through dictionary keys (U unique numbers): O(U), and U ≤ N.
  - No sorting here, so overall: O(N) time.

Space: O(U) ≈ O(N)
  - same as before

  
----------------------------------------------
Q: Why was the original time complexity O(N + k log k), but now it's only O(N)?

A: Because of the sorting step in the earlier version:
   • return sorted(ans) sorts the intersection result.
   • Sorting k elements costs O(k log k).
   • That's why the total time was O(N + k log k).

In this new version:
   • We just return ans without sorting.
   • No k log k cost → only the counting and scanning remain.
   • Total time is O(N).
