# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

# Example 4: Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

# A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

# Example 1:
    # Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 3
    # Output: 2 (subarrays [1, 2] and [3])

# Example 2:
    # Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], k = 3
    # Output: 4 (subarrays [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1])

Time: O(n)
  - Loop through nums once: O(n) iterations.
  - Dictionary lookups and updates ('counts[curr - k]', 'counts[curr] += 1') are O(1) on average.
  - No nested loops, so total time is O(n).

Space: O(n)
  - Dictionary 'counts' can store up to n different prefix sums in the worst case: O(n) space.
  - A few variables (curr, ans, num) take O(1) space.
  - Overall: O(n) total space.

  
Q: What is the key and value of counts?

  • Key: running prefix sum (sum of elements up to current index).

  • Value: how many prefixes have had that exact sum so far.

  • Why counts[0] = 1: seeds the empty prefix (sum 0) so subarrays starting at index 0 are counted.

Final: 4 (subarrays [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1])


Subarrays found:
    • i=1: curr=3, curr-k=0, counts[0]=1 -> [1, 2] (sum=3)
    • i=2: curr=4, curr-k=1, counts[1]=1 -> [2, 1] (sum=3)
    • i=3: curr=6, curr-k=3, counts[3]=1 -> [1, 2] (sum=3)
    • i=4: curr=7, curr-k=4, counts[4]=1 -> [2, 1] (sum=3)




Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • curr is the running sum up to the current index.

    • If a previous running sum equals (curr - k), then the numbers after that point up to now sum to k. 

    • counts stores how many times each running sum has appeared.
    
    • counts[0] = 1 handles subarrays that start at index 0.

Why this code Works:
    • Hash map (counts): key = running sum value, value = how many times we've seen it so far.

    • Prefix sum idea: a subarray sums to k when curr - prev = k  →  prev = curr - k.

    • counts[curr - k] tells us how many subarrays ending at the current index add up to k, so we add that to ans.

    • counts[curr] += 1 records the current running sum so future elements can check against it.

    • One pass, O(n) time; O(1) average lookups; avoids O(n^2) brute-force checks.

TLDR:
    • Track running sums and, at each index, add how many earlier sums equal (curr - k) — that gives the number of subarrays ending here whose sum is exactly k.


Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], k = 3

    Step 1 (setup): counts = {0:1}, curr = 0, ans = 0

    Step 2 (iterate):
        • +1 → curr=1 → curr-k=-2 → counts[-2]=0 → ans=0 → counts[1]=1

        • +2 → curr=3 → curr-k=0  → counts[0]=1  → ans=1 → counts[3]=1   # subarray [1, 2]

        • +1 → curr=4 → curr-k=1  → counts[1]=1  → ans=2 → counts[4]=1   # subarray [2, 1]

        • +2 → curr=6 → curr-k=3  → counts[3]=1  → ans=3 → counts[6]=1   # subarray [1, 2]

        • +1 → curr=7 → curr-k=4  → counts[4]=1  → ans=4 → counts[7]=1   # subarray [2, 1]

    Final Answer: 4



    

Subarray Sum Equals K — Why `counts[0] = 1` and how (curr - k) works
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Core idea (prefix-sum logic):
  - Let `curr` be the running sum up to the current index.
  - If there exists a previous running sum equal to `curr - k`, then the subarray after that previous point up to now sums to k.

Reason:
    previous_sum = curr - k  ⟺  k = curr - previous_sum 

    The difference between two prefix sums is the sum of the elements between them.


Ultra-simple numeric example:
------------------------------------------------
nums = [2, 1, 3], k = 3

Running sums as we scan (include the initial 0 because of counts[0] = 1):
    prefix_sums = [0,   2,  3,  6]
                   ^    ^   ^   ^
                   |    |   |   |
    Indices:      (-1)  0   1   2   (conceptual -1 before the array starts)

Check differences to find subarrays summing to k:
- At curr = 3 (after seeing [2, 1]):
    curr - k = 3 - 3 = 0
    Have we seen a prefix sum of 0 before? Yes (the seeded one).
    → Subarray (after that 0) is [2, 1], and its sum is 3. ✅

- At curr = 6 (after seeing [2, 1, 3]):
    curr - k = 6 - 3 = 3
    Have we seen a prefix sum of 3 before? Yes (after [2, 1]).
    → Subarray (after that 3) is [3], and its sum is 3. ✅

Mental picture with just numbers:
    prefix_sums: [0, 2, 3, 6]
    differences: (3 - 0) = 3  → subarray [2, 1]
                 (6 - 3) = 3  → subarray [3]

Takeaway:
  • Every time you can find an earlier prefix sum exactly k smaller than the current prefix sum, the chunk between them totals k.






-------------------OLD BREAKDOWN-------------------

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:    
    • TLDR: If counts[curr - k] exists → curr - prev = k, so that subarray sums to k. 

    • counts[curr - k] tells how many such subarrays end at the current index.

    
Explanation for Beginners: Why this code works
    • If some earlier running total was exactly (curr - k), then the numbers AFTER that point up to i sum to k.
        • “After that point” is what people mean by “prev_index + 1” — start right after where that earlier total was measured.

    • counts is a hash map where counts[prefix] = how many times we've seen that running total before.

    • Finally, we record today's total for future checks: counts[curr] += 1.


Example (quick sanity check):
    • nums = [1, 2], k = 3
    • prefix totals: 1, 3
    • at curr = 3 ⇒ curr - k = 0 ⇒ counts[0] = 1 ⇒ one subarray [1, 2].

    
Note: The code determines only the total number of subarrays with a sum equal to k, confirming their existence through prefix sum matches without specifying which subarrays they are.

"""
Note on defaultdict and "extra" keys (e.g., -2:0)

Why it happens:
    • defaultdict(int) auto-creates keys with value 0 when you *access* a missing key.
    • Example: counts[curr - k] → if (curr - k) not in counts, it gets inserted as 0.

What you'll see:
    • Tools like Python Tutor may show entries like {-2: 0}.
    • A manual iteration table might skip these since they don’t affect the result.

Does it matter?
    • No — these extra 0-entries do NOT affect correctness.
    • They are harmless placeholders.

How to avoid it:
    • Use counts.get(curr - k, 0) when you just want to *check* a value.
    • .get() returns 0 without creating a new key.

Key takeaway:
    • defaultdict[int] = convenient for counting, but remember it auto-inserts on access.
    • Extra keys with value 0 are normal and safe to ignore.

Final: 2 (subarrays [1,2], [3])


------------------------------------------------
Q: Why do we set counts[0] = 1 at the start?

counts[0] = 1

  • We conceptually include a "prefix sum before the array starts" with value 0.

  • This seeds the count so that if `curr == k` at some index i,
  the subarray from 0..i is correctly counted (because curr - k = 0 is “already seen” once).

  In other words, we start with a single occurrence of prefix sum 0 to allow subarrays starting at index 0.

  • Seeding `counts[0] = 1` makes sure subarrays starting at the very beginning are counted.


Why do we need this?
    • It's a starting point that says:
      “Before we add any numbers, we already have one way to make a sum of 0.”
    • This makes it possible to count subarrays that start at the very beginning of the array.

---
Example 1: nums = [1, 2], k = 3
    • Running sum (curr) starts at 0.
    • First number → curr = 1
    • Second number → curr = 3

Now check: curr - k = 3 - 3 = 0
    • If counts[0] wasn't initialized to 1, the code would miss the subarray [1, 2] because it wouldn't recognize that the sum from the start equals k.

---
Example 2: nums = [3, 2, 1], k = 3
    • Running sum (curr) starts at 0.

    Step 1:
        • Add 3 → curr = 3
        • Check curr - k = 3 - 3 = 0
        • counts[0] = 1 → valid subarray [3]

    Step 2:
        • Add 2 → curr = 5
        • Check curr - k = 5 - 3 = 2
        • counts[2] = 0 → no match

    Step 3:
        • Add 1 → curr = 6
        • Check curr - k = 6 - 3 = 3
        • counts[3] = 1 (from Step 1) → valid subarray [2, 1]

    ✅ Total valid subarrays = 2 → [3], [2, 1]

---
✅ So counts[0] = 1 is like saying:
    • “We've seen a zero-sum once already, before starting. That way, if the running total hits k, we know we found a valid subarray starting at index 0.”



------------------------------------------------
Q: Can ans increase by more than 1 in a single iteration?

    • Yes, if multiple previous prefix sums match `curr - k`.
    • At each step we do: ans += counts[curr - k].
    • If counts[curr - k] = m, then there are m valid subarrays ending at this index.
    • This means ans can jump by m at once (e.g., go from 1 → 3).

Example:
    • nums = [1, -1, 1, -1], k = 0
    • Prefix sums: [1, 0, 1, 0]
    • At i=3 (curr = 0), counts[0] = 2
    • ans increases by 2 in this step → total ans goes from 2 → 4

Key insight:
    • With only positive numbers, prefix sums are strictly increasing, so ans increases by at most 1 each step.
    • With zeros or negatives, prefix sums can repeat → ans can increase by more than 1 in one iteration.

Key insight:
    • With only positive numbers, prefix sums are strictly increasing, so ans increases by at most 1 each step.
    • With zeros or negatives, prefix sums can repeat → ans can increase by more than 1 in one iteration.
    • When there are non-positive numbers, the same prefix can occur multiple times, so we need a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of frequencies instead of just storing seen values once.
