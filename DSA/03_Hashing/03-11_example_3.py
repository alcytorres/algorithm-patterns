# 1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

# Example 3: 
# Given a string s, determine if all characters have the same frequency.

# A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

# For example, given s = "abacbc", return true, because all characters appear twice. Given s = "aaabb", return false. "a" appears 3 times, "b" appears 2 times. 3 != 2.

# Example:
# Input: s = "abacbc"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.

def areOccurrencesEqual(s):



string = "abacbc"
print(areOccurrencesEqual(string))
