# 1426. Counting Elements

# Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. 

# If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

# Example:
    # Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: 1, 2, and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-elements/solutions/567376/counting-elements/


# Optimized Solution: Search with HashSet
def countElements(arr):
    hash_set = set(arr)
    count = 0
    
    for x in arr:
        if x + 1 in hash_set:
            count += 1
    return count

arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
print(countElements(arr))
# Output: 3


"""
Time: O(N)
  - Let N = length of arr.
  - Step 1: Build a set from arr → O(N).
      • Each insertion takes O(1) average.
  - Step 2: Loop through arr → O(N).
      • For each element x, check if x + 1 is in the set → O(1) average.
  - Overall: O(N + N) = O(N).

Space: O(N)
  - The set 'hash_set' stores up to N unique numbers.
  - A few scalar variables (count, x) use O(1).
  - Overall: O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(N)
  - Build hash set and scan all elements once.

Space: O(N)
  - Hash set holds all unique values from arr.

Overview for Each Iteration
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]

Step 1: Create set of unique elements
hash_set = {1, 2, 3}

Step 2: Count elements x where x + 1 is in hash_set
x   | x + 1 | x + 1 in hash_set | count
----|-------|-------------------|------
1   | 2     | True              | 1
2   | 3     | True              | 2
2   | 3     | True              | 3
3   | 4     | False             | 3

Final: 3

Q: Why use a set instead of a array for lookups?
    • Set lookups are O(1) on average (hash table).
    • Array lookups are O(n) since they scan sequentially.

    
Q: What is the key idea of the solution?
    • Store all numbers in a hash set.
    • For each number x in arr, check if x+1 exists in the set.
    • Count it if true.

    
Q: Why do duplicates count separately?
    • We iterate through arr directly, so duplicates are checked individually.

Time: O(n^2)
  - Outer loop iterates over all n elements.
  - Each 'x + 1 in arr' check is a list lookup, which takes O(n) in the worst case.
  - Overall: O(n * n) = O(n^2) time.

Space: O(n)
  - Set 'seen' stores up to n elements: O(n) space.
  - A few variables (x, count) take O(1) space.
  - Overall: O(n) total space.



⚠️ Why This Solution is Inefficient
    • Each x+1 in arr lookup is O(n) because arr is a list.

    • You do this for every element (n iterations).

    • Total time complexity = O(n²).

    • For small inputs, fine. For large arr (like 10⁵ elements), this will time out on LeetCode.

🔑 Key Difference: Set vs. List Lookup Complexity
    • Set lookup: O(1) on average — uses a hash table for near-instant access.

    • List lookup: O(n) — requires scanning elements sequentially until a match is found.
