# 1426. Counting Elements

# Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. 

# If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

# Example:
    # Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
    # Output: 3
    # Explanation: 1, 2, and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-elements/solutions/567376/counting-elements/


# Optimized Solution: Search with HashSet
def countElements(arr):
    hash_set = set(arr)
    count = 0
    
    for x in arr:
        if x + 1 in hash_set:
            count += 1
    return count

arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
print(countElements(arr))
# Output: 3


# Time: O(n)
# - Creating the set from arr: O(n).
# - Loop through arr once: O(n) iterations.
# - Set lookups ('x + 1 in hash_set') are O(1) on average.
# - Overall: O(n) time.

# Space: O(n)
# - Set 'hash_set' stores up to n elements: O(n) space.
# - A few variables (count, x) take O(1) space.
# - Overall: O(n) total space.


"""
Overview for Each Iteration
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
Step 1: Create set of unique elements
hash_set = {1, 2, 3}

Step 2: Count elements x where x + 1 is in hash_set
x  | x + 1 | x + 1 in hash_set | count
1  | 2     | True              | 1
2  | 3     | True              | 2
2  | 3     | True              | 3
3  | 4     | False             | 3
Final: 3



---------------------------------------------------
Q: Why use a set instead of a array for lookups?
    • Set lookups are O(1) on average (hash table).
    • Array lookups are O(n) since they scan sequentially.

    
Q: What is the key idea of the solution?
    • Store all numbers in a hash set.
    • For each number x in arr, check if x+1 exists in the set.
    • Count it if true.

    
Q: Why do duplicates count separately?
    • We iterate through arr directly, so duplicates are checked individually.

"""
⚠️ Why This Solution is Inefficient
    • Each x+1 in arr lookup is O(n) because arr is a list.

    • You do this for every element (n iterations).

    • Total time complexity = O(n²).

    • For small inputs, fine. For large arr (like 10⁵ elements), this will time out on LeetCode.

"""
🔑 Key Difference: Set vs. List Lookup Complexity
    • Set lookup: O(1) on average — uses a hash table for near-instant access.

    • List lookup: O(n) — requires scanning elements sequentially until a match is found.
