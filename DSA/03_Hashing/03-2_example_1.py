# 1. Two Sum

# Example 1
    # Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

# Example:
    # Input: nums = [3, 1, 7, 4, -6], target = 5
    # Output: [1, 3]
    # Explanation: Because nums[1] + nums[3] == 5, we return [1, 3] or [3, 1].

            return [i, d[diff]]
        d[num] = i      # Store number and index

    return []

nums = [3, 1, 7, 4, -6]
target = 5
print(twoSum(nums, target))  
# Output: [3, 1] → Indices [3, 1] correspond to numbers [4, 1], and 4 + 1 = 5 matches the target.


"""
Time: O(N)
  - Let N = length of nums.
  - Loop through nums once → O(N).
      • For each num, check if (target - num) exists in dictionary → O(1) average.
      • Insert current num into dictionary → O(1).
  - Each element is processed exactly once.
  - Overall: O(N).

Space: O(N)
  - Dictionary 'd' stores up to N key-value pairs (num → index).
  - A few variables (i, num, diff) use O(1) space.
  - Overall: O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(N)
  - Single pass with constant-time hash lookups.

Space: O(N)
  - Dictionary stores previously seen numbers.



Overview for Each Iteration
Input: nums = [3, 1, 7, 4, -6], target = 5

Step: Find indices of two numbers summing to target
i  | num  | diff (target - num) | d                   | Action
---|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------
0  | 3    | 2 (5 - 3)           | {3: 0}              | Store 3 at index 0
1  | 1    | 4 (5 - 1)           | {3: 0, 1: 1}        | Store 1 at index 1
2  | 7    | -2 (5 - 7)          | {3: 0, 1: 1, 7: 2}  | Store 7 at index 2
3  | 4    | 1 (5 - 4)           | {3: 0, 1: 1, 7: 2}  | Found 1 in d, return [3, 1]

Final: [3, 1] (nums[1] + nums[3] = 1 + 4 = 5)



-------------------------------------------------
Q: Why do we use `d[num] = i` instead of `d[diff] = i`?

  • d is a lookup table of numbers we've already seen.

  • We store what we have (num), not what we need (diff).

  • When we see a new number, we check if its complement (diff) was seen before.

  • If yes → diff is already in d, meaning we've found the pair.

  • If no → we store the current number (num) so future numbers can find it later.

  👉 d[num] = i keeps track of “I've seen this number at this index.”
  👉 Using d[diff] = i would wrongly store what we don't have yet.

"""
Time: O(n)
  - Loop through nums once: O(n) iterations.
  - Dictionary lookups ('if complement in d') and inserts ('d[num] = i') are O(1) on average.
  - No nested loops, so total time is O(n).

Space: O(n)
  - Dictionary 'd' can store up to n elements in the worst case (when no match is found until the end), O(n) space.
  - A few integer variables (i, num, complement) take O(1) space.
  - Overall: O(n) total space.
  - If we exclude the dictionary from consideration (not typical here since it's part of the algorithm), extra space is O(1).

As soon as a difference matches a num you found the answer. In this case that difference is 1.
