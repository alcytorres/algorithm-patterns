"""
Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • We want the longest subarray where 0s and 1s are equal.  

    • Replace each 1 with +1 and each 0 with -1.  
      → Now the problem becomes finding the longest subarray where the total sum = 0 (equal 1s and 0s).  

    • diff = running balance (how many more 1s than 0s we've seen so far).  

    • If the same diff value shows up again, everything between those two indices must have balanced out (equal 0s and 1s).  

Why this code Works:
    • Hash map (counts): stores the first index where each diff value was seen.  

    • Prefix sum idea: diff acts like a prefix sum of (+1 for 1, –1 for 0).  
      → If diff repeats at index i and j, the subarray between i+1 and j has net zero difference → equal 0s and 1s.  

    • Efficiency: O(n) because we only scan once and use O(1) lookups in the map.  
      Brute force would check every subarray in O(n²).  

    • Intuition: Think of diff as your "scoreboard." If you're at the same score twice, everything in between must have tied up perfectly.  

TLDR:
    • Track the balance of 1s and 0s with diff; if diff repeats, the subarray between those two points is balanced.  

Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]  

    Step 1: Initialize counts = {0:-1} (diff=0 seen before the array starts).  
            This lets us catch subarrays starting at index 0.  

    Step 2: Process elements one by one:  

        i=0, num=0 → diff=-1 (first time) → save counts[-1]=0.  
        i=1, num=1 → diff=0 (seen at -1) → subarray length = 1 - (-1) = 2.  
        i=2, num=1 → diff=1 (first time) → save counts[1]=2.  
        i=3, num=1 → diff=2 (first time) → save counts[2]=3.  
        i=4, num=1 → diff=3 (first time) → save counts[3]=4.  
        i=5, num=1 → diff=4 (first time) → save counts[4]=5.  
        i=6, num=0 → diff=3 (seen at 4) → subarray length = 6 - 4 = 2.  
        i=7, num=0 → diff=2 (seen at 3) → subarray length = 7 - 3 = 4.  
        i=8, num=0 → diff=1 (seen at 2) → subarray length = 8 - 2 = 6.  

    Step 3: Maximum length found = 6.  

    Final Answer: 6 → subarray [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].

Q: Why the Loop Works

     • Loop structure (for i, num in enumerate(nums):):
       We need both the element (num) and its position (i), because the index tells us where a score first happened and lets us calculate subarray lengths.

    • Update score (diff):
      Add +1 for a 1, subtract -1 for a 0.
      → This running score shows how many more 1s than 0s we've seen so far.

    • Check notebook (if diff in counts):
       If this score was seen before, the subarray between then and now must balance out (same number of 0s and 1s).
       → Length = current index - first index of this score.

    • Update notebook (counts[diff] = i):
       If this score hasn't been seen yet, record the index where it first appeared.
       → Important: only store the earliest index, since that gives the longest subarray later.

    • Why it finds the answer:
      Same score twice = balance in between. By always comparing with the first time that score appeared, we guarantee we find the longest balanced chunk.

      

# –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Q: Why counts[0] = -1?

    What it does: Pretends the score 0 happened at index -1 (before the array starts).

    Why needed: This lets us catch subarrays that start at index 0. When diff returns to 0, we can measure the full length as i - (-1).

    Example:
    For [0, 1]:

    At index 1, diff = 0.
    With counts[0] = -1, length = 1 - (-1) = 2 → correct full subarray [0, 1].

    Why it works: It sets a baseline: we “start” balanced (0 score). So anytime we return to score 0, the subarray from the beginning is counted.

    Without it: Subarrays beginning at index 0 would never be recognized as balanced.

# Why counts[0] = -1?
    # What it does: The notebook (counts) tracks our score (diff, which is 1s minus 0s) and where we saw it. Setting counts[0] = -1 means we pretend our score is 0 before the list starts (at step -1).

    # Why needed: We want to find chunks with equal 0s and 1s, including chunks that start at the beginning (index 0). If our score (diff) becomes 0, like after [0, 1], it means the chunk from the start is balanced. counts[0] = -1 lets us measure this chunk's length correctly: current step - (-1).

# Why “Score is 0 before we start”?
    # Before we look at any numbers, we haven't seen any 1s or 0s, so our score (diff = 1s - 0s) is 0 (no hills or valleys yet).

    # We set counts[0] = -1 to say, “At step -1 (before the list), our score was 0.” This helps us catch subarrays starting from index 0.

    Example: nums = [0, 1] (Output: 2)
    Start: counts = {0: -1}, diff = 0, max_length = 0.
    Step 0 (num = 0):
        diff = 0 - 1 = -1. Not in counts. Add counts[-1] = 0.
        max_length = 0.

    Step 1 (num = 1):
        diff = -1 + 1 = 0. counts[0] = -1 exists!
        Length = 1 - (-1) = 2 (chunk [0, 1] has one 0, one 1).
        max_length = 2.

# Why counts[0] = -1 worked: When diff = 0 at step 1, we found a balanced chunk from the start (step -1 to 1), giving length 2.


# Analogy
    # Think of walking a path: 1s are steps up (+1), 0s are steps down (-1). Your score (diff) is your height. Before you start, you're at ground level (score 0). We write in the notebook, “Ground level at step -1,” so if you hit ground level again (like after [0, 1]), we know the chunk from the start is balanced. Using -1 ensures the length calculation (current step - (-1)) works for chunks starting at 0.

# Why It Works
    # counts[0] = -1 lets us catch balanced subarrays starting from the beginning. Without it, we'd miss chunks like [0, 1]. Only -1 gives the correct length for these cases!7.1s
