# 2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up

# You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

# Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

 
# Example:
# Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
# Output: 4

# Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
