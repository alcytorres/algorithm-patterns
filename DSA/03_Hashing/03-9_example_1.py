# Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

# Example 1: You are given a string s and an integer k. Find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

# Example
    # Input: s = "eceba" and k = 2, 
    # Output: return 3.
    # The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is "ece".

# ece (positions 0-2): Characters {e, c} → 2 distinct → valid.
# ceb (positions 1-3): Characters {c, e, b} → 3 distinct → invalid.
# eba (positions 2-4): Characters {e, b, a} → 3 distinct → invalid.

"""
Time: O(n)
  - Right pointer moves across the string once.
  - Left pointer also moves at most n steps in total.
  - Each character is added to and removed from the dictionary at most once.
  - Dictionary operations (add, update, delete) are O(1) on average.
  - Overall: O(n) time.

Space: O(k)
  - Dictionary 'counts' stores at most k distinct characters at any time.
  - A few variables (left, right, ans) take O(1) space.
  - Overall: O(k) space, which is O(1) if k is considered a small constant.

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • We use a sliding window (left → right) to keep track of a substring.  

    • counts stores how many times each character appears inside the window.  

    • If the window has more than k distinct characters, we shrink it from the left until it's valid again.  

    • ans always records the longest valid window length seen so far.  

Why this code Works:
    • Hash map (counts): keeps track of characters inside the current window and their counts.  

    • Sliding window idea: expand right to include new chars, shrink left if > k distinct chars.  

    • Efficiency: each character is added once and removed once → O(n) total.  

    • Intuition: like stretching a rubber band (window) across the string — make it as long as possible without including more than k distinct characters.  

TLDR:
    • Grow a window across the string, shrink it when > k distinct characters, and track the max valid window length.  

Quick Example Walkthrough:
    s = "eceba", k = 2  

    Step 1: right=0 → "e" → counts={e:1}, ans=1  
    Step 2: right=1 → "ec" → counts={e:1, c:1}, ans=2  
    Step 3: right=2 → "ece" → counts={e:2, c:1}, ans=3  

    Step 4: right=3 → "eceb" → counts={e:2, c:1, b:1} → too many distinct → shrink left: remove e, then c → window="eb" → ans=3  

    Step 5: right=4 → "eba" → counts={e:1, b:1, a:1} → too many distinct → shrink left: remove e → window="ba" → ans=3  

    Final Answer: 3 ("ece")  



---------------------------------------------------
Q: Why use defaultdict instead of regular dictionary {}?
    • Automatically initializes missing keys with 0.
    • Simplifies code by avoiding manual existence checks.
    • Makes counting operations cleaner and less error-prone.
