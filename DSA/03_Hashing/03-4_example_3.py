# Example 3: Given an integer array nums, find all the numbers x in nums that satisfy the following: x + 1 is not in nums, and x - 1 is not in nums.

# If a valid number x appears multiple times, you only need to include it in the answer once.


# Example:
# Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 4]
# Output: [3, 4]
# Explanation: For x=3, 3+1=4 and 3-1=2 are not in nums. For x=4, 4+1=5 and 4-1=3 are in nums, but 4 satisfies since duplicates are handled. Only unique valid x are included.
