Symbol  | Meaning / When it Appears                          | Example
--------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------
n       | Main input size (length of array, string, etc.)    | Traverse array of n elements → O(n)
m       | Second input size (two arrays, grid dimensions)    | Merge arrays of size n and m → O(n + m)
k       | Special size (window length, substring length)     | Sliding window of size k → O(n * k)
1       | Constant work, independent of input size           | Swap two variables → O(1)
log n   | Input is halved each step                          | Binary search on n elements → O(log n)
n², n³  | Nested loops (2 or 3 levels)                       | Double loop over n × n grid → O(n²)
n!      | Factorial growth (all permutations)                | Generate all permutations of n → O(n!)

Q: “What's the difference between O(U) and O(N) in time/space complexity analysis?”

O(U) vs O(N)
    N = total number of elements.
    U = number of unique elements.
    Always: U ≤ N.

Worst case: if all elements are unique, then U = N → O(U) = O(N).

Best case: if there are many duplicates, U ≪ N → O(U) is tighter and more efficient.

Interview tip:
    • Saying O(N) is always safe.
    
    • Saying O(U) is more precise — just explain that in the worst case it's O(N), but in practice U may be much smaller.
    
    • Rule of thumb: use O(N) for clarity, use O(U) when you want to impress with precision.

COMPLEXITY TEMPLATE — STUDY + INTERVIEW FORMAT

Instructions:
- Sometimes the exact TIME and SPACE are the same as what you say in an interview.  
- Always use CAPS for complexity: O(N), O(1), not o(n).  
- Only add the necessary bullets:
  * Don't overdo it with too many details.  
  * Don't swing too far into being overly concise.  
  * Use the optimal amount so a beginner can quickly understand and recall.  
- Some cases (like #2225 Find Players With Zero or One Losses) may need more bullets because more is going on.  
- Typical problems should use fewer bullets.  
- STUDY ANSWER = thorough, with step breakdowns and worst-case reasoning.  
- INTERVIEW ANSWER = simplified to worst-case, with 1-2 bullets explaining “why” directly.
- REMEMBER I'm a beginner so the bullet explanations for the Study Answer should be very simple and easy to follow. If you need more bullets or to make them a little longer because you think that will make it easier for me follow do so
Place your answer inside """ """ in a .py file with a code block. Don't include the code; just the time and space template.

------------------------------------------------
TEMPLATE:

Time: O(...)
  - Define variables (e.g., N = input size, U = unique numbers, P = unique players, etc).
  - List main steps and their costs.
  - Show the combined overall time complexity.
  - Add worst-case relationship if relevant (e.g., P ≤ N).

Space: O(...)
  - State main structures and their sizes.
  - Mention output if relevant.
  - Give overall space complexity.
  - Add worst-case tie-back if relevant.

  
Interview Answer: Worst Case

Time: O(...)
  - 1-2 bullets highlighting the dominant step(s).

Space: O(...)
  - 1-2 bullets summarizing memory usage at a high level.

"""
Time: O(N + P log P)
  - Let N = number of matches, P = number of unique players.
  - Process all matches once to update dict + set → O(N).
  - Scan players to build zero_loss and one_loss → O(P).
  - Sort both lists → O(P log P).
  - Overall: O(N + P log P).
  - Since P ≤ 2N, worst case is O(N log N).

Space: O(P) ≈ O(N)
  - Dict 'losses' stores up to P players.
  - Set 'seen' stores up to P players.
  - Output lists (zero_loss, one_loss) store up to P players.
  - Overall: O(P).
  - Since P ≤ 2N, worst case O(P) = O(N).

  
Interview Answer: Worse Case

Time: O(N log N)
  - Process matches in O(N).
  - Sorting dominates → O(N log N).

Space: O(N)
  - Dictionary and set track up to N players.
  - Extra space is linear.
