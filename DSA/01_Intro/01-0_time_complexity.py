Symbol  | Meaning / When it Appears                          | Example
--------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------
n       | Main input size (length of array, string, etc.)    | Traverse array of n elements → O(n)
m       | Second input size (two arrays, grid dimensions)    | Merge arrays of size n and m → O(n + m)
k       | Special size (window length, substring length)     | Sliding window of size k → O(n * k)
1       | Constant work, independent of input size           | Swap two variables → O(1)
log n   | Input is halved each step                          | Binary search on n elements → O(log n)
n², n³  | Nested loops (2 or 3 levels)                       | Double loop over n × n grid → O(n²)
n!      | Factorial growth (all permutations)                | Generate all permutations of n → O(n!)

Q: “What's the difference between O(U) and O(N) in time/space complexity analysis?”

O(U) vs O(N)
    N = total number of elements.
    U = number of unique elements.
    Always: U ≤ N.

Worst case: if all elements are unique, then U = N → O(U) = O(N).

Best case: if there are many duplicates, U ≪ N → O(U) is tighter and more efficient.

Interview tip:
    • Saying O(N) is always safe.
    
    • Saying O(U) is more precise — just explain that in the worst case it's O(N), but in practice U may be much smaller.
    
    • Rule of thumb: use O(N) for clarity, use O(U) when you want to impress with precision.
