# Output: 4  --> Substring "1011" (length 4, one "0") is the longest with at most one "0".

# Time: O(n)
# - Right pointer moves across the string once.
# - Left pointer also moves at most n steps in total.
# - Each character is processed (added/removed from count) at most once.
# - No nested loops that multiply time.

# Space: O(1)
# - Only a constant number of variables (left, right, curr, ans) are used.
# - No additional data structures.
# - Overall: O(1) space.
