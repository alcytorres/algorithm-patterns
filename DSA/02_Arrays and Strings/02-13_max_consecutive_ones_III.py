# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III 

# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

# Example:
    # Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], k = 2
    # Output: 6
    # Explanation: nums[5] and nums[10] were flipped from 0 to 1. We are left with [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] 

# Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/solutions/409192/max-consecutive-ones-iii/

def longestOnes(nums, k):
    left = ans = curr = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            curr += 1
        
        while curr > k:

nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
k = 2
print(longestOnes(nums, k))
# Output: 6

# Time: O(n)
# - Right pointer moves across the array once.
# - Left pointer also moves at most n steps in total.
# - Each element is processed (added/removed from count) at most once.
# - No nested loops that multiply time.

# Space: O(1)
# - Only a constant number of variables (left, right, curr, ans) are used.
# - No additional data structures.
# - Overall: O(1) space.

Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • We want the longest stretch of 1s, but we can flip at most k zeros into 1s.

    • We use a sliding window: expand with right, shrink with left if too many zeros are inside.

    • The current window is always valid (≤ k zeros), and we track the maximum length.

    
Why this code Works:
    • curr: counts how many zeros are in the current window.

    • Sliding window: grow window by moving right; if curr > k, shrink window from the left until valid.

    • Efficiency: each element is added/removed once → O(n) time, O(1) space.

    • Intuition: Like stretching a rubber band over the array — expand until it breaks the “≤ k zeros” rule, then pull in the left side to fix it.

    
TLDR
    • Keep a window with at most k zeros. Expand right, shrink left if needed. Track the largest valid window size.

    
Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2

    Step 1: Expand → [1,1,1,0,0], zeros = 2 → window length = 5.

    Step 2: Add next 0 → zeros = 3 → shrink left until zeros = 2.

    Step 3: Expand with [1,1,1,1] → zeros = 2 → window length = 6 (best).

    Step 4: Add final 0 → zeros = 3 → shrink again, still best = 6.

Final Answer: 6 (subarray [1,1,1,1,1,1]).



---------------------------------------------------
Q: Which subarray of length 6 is the final answer?
    • Both [4..9] (flip nums[4] & nums[5]) and [5..10] (flip nums[5] & nums[10]) give a streak of 6 ones.

    • LeetCode's official explanation shows [5..10] as the answer (flipping nums[5] and nums[10]).

	• The algorithm only returns the max length (6), not which subarray produced it.
