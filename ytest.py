# Super simple, beginner-friendly Leetocde FULL breakdown

# I need a super simple, beginner-friendly explanation of how this LeetCode solution works, as if explaining to a 12-year-old who’s just learning to code. Break it down crystal clear, focusing on why the code finds the correct answer for the given problem. 

# Use the provided example input and output to walk through the solution step by step, showing how each part of the code contributes to the final result. Include a simple analogy to make it relatable. If the solution uses a loop, provide a concise iteration overview (like a table) showing key variable changes for each step.



# ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
# I need a super simple, easy to follow, very beginner-friendly explanation of how this LeetCode solution works. Break it down into 4 main parts: "Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand", "Why this code Works, TLDR (why this code works in one sentence), and Quick Example Walkthrough.

# Make it crystal clear, focusing on why the code finds the correct answer for the given problem. I should be able to look back at this at any time and quickly follow along and understand it. 

# ⚠️ It is important you be concise and have no fluff in your reply. You should not sacrifice clarity, but if something can be said in fewer words without losing understanding, then use fewer words. This requires a delicate balance: always aim for maximum clarity with minimum words.

# Between each bullet point skip a line to space out the breakdown and make it more easy to scan

# Here is a great template with more detail of what I'm looking that you can you as a reference. While I want you to generally follow this template it is not rigid. If you think adding a little more detail to a specific problem is necessary for me to fully understand make sure to do that.

"""
Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • [Key intuition in 2–3 bullets — e.g., what the main variable tracks or what the core idea is]

    • [State the condition that guarantees we’ve found a valid answer, in plain words]

    • [If applicable, point out what the hash map / set / pointer is doing in simple terms]

Why this code Works:
    • Hash map / data structure role: [Explain what it stores and why it’s useful]

    • Prefix sum / sliding window / two pointers idea: [Explain how the technique applies here]

    • Efficiency: [1–2 bullets on why this avoids brute force, O(n) vs O(n^2)]

    • Intuition: [Beginner analogy — “like tallying votes”, “like keeping a running score”, etc.]

Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [example input], k = [value if relevant]

    Step 1: [Describe what happens as you process elements one by one, how key variables (like curr, odd, counts, etc.) change]

    Step 2: [Show the subarrays / result as they’re discovered]

    Final Answer: [Result]

# Example to reference:

def largestUniqueNumber(nums):

# Example breakdown to reference: 
"""
Most IMPORTANT thing to Understand:
    • We need to find the largest number in the array that occurs exactly once.

    • First, we count how many times each number appears.

    • Then we check which numbers are unique (count == 1) and pick the largest one.

    • If no number is unique, we return -1.

Why this code Works:
    • Hash map (counts): stores how many times each number appears.

    • Scan through counts:
        • If a number's count == 1 → it's unique.
        • Compare with current max_unique and update if larger.

    • Efficiency: Instead of checking subarrays or sorting, we just tally counts in O(n) and then make one pass over the results.

    • Intuition: Think of it like a vote tally — each number “gets votes.” We only want numbers that got exactly one vote, and we pick the biggest of those.

TLDR
    • This solution works because we count how often each number appears, then pick the largest one that occurs exactly once.
    
Quick Example Walkthrough:
    nums = [1, 3, 9, 4, 9, 8, 3]

    Step 1: Count frequencies
        counts = {1:1, 3:2, 9:2, 4:1, 8:1}

    Step 2: Check unique numbers
        • 1 → count=1, max_unique = 1
        • 3 → count=2, skip
        • 9 → count=2, skip
        • 4 → count=1, max_unique = 4
        • 8 → count=1, max_unique = 8

    Final Answer: 8

Q: What is the best efficient simple solution for a beginner to understand this problem?

The goal is:
• Clarity: easy-to-follow explanation.
• Learning: helps me actually understand the reasoning.
• Retention: highest probability I remember the solution later.

Instructions for you (the LLM):
    1. Reflect on 3-4 different possible efficeint approaches. Don't pick brute force that will be done later. Show the code for each solution.

    2. Distill those down into the top 1-2 candidate solutions, and explain why they’re better than the others.

    3. Pick the one solution that you think is best for my use case (beginner-friendly + efficient).

    4. Explain it excellently with:
        • The key idea in plain language.
        • Why it works.
        • Why it's simpler/better for a beginner than the alternatives.
        • Small example to illustrate.

    5. Justify your choice so I can understand the tradeoffs.

    The solution needs to maximize retention — meaning the highest chance I’ll actually remember it later. For that to work, I prefer the code to stay concise, but never at the expense of simplicity.

# Give me time and space for the following in this format:
    # Format like this
    # Time: O(n)
    # - Loop through nums once: O(n) iterations.
    # - Dictionary lookups and updates ('counts[curr - k]', 'counts[curr] += 1') are O(1) on average.
    # - No nested loops, so total time is O(n).

    # Space: O(n)
    # - Dictionary 'counts' can store up to n different prefix sums in the worst case: O(n) space.
    # - A few variables (curr, ans, num) take O(1) space.
