# 4. Find Pair with Target Difference
"""
Task: Find two numbers in an array whose difference is a given target. The larger number minus the smaller should equal the target.
Example: [1, 3, 5, 8], target = 2 â†’ [1, 3]
Why: Prepares for Two Sum by practicing pointer movement for a condition.

# Solution
def find_pair_with_difference(arr, target):   # Define the function that takes an array 'arr' and an integer 'target' as inputs
    """
    Finds two numbers in the array whose difference equals the target.
    
    - Sorts array first, then uses two pointers to find the pair.
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, Space Complexity: O(1).
    - Sorting simplifies the problem for beginners, though a hash table could be O(n).
